# YouTube Daily Count Limiter

This is a simple chrome extension that limits the number of videos you watch per day to avoid addiction.

### Why not just limit usage using screentime?
Not all videos are made equal; If you limit YouTube usage by time, then for the same amount of time you may watch a ton of short videos, or a few longer videos. I believe the latter is less detrimental to one's attention span. In fact, one could argue certain long educational videos (such as online tutorials, topical video essays) should not be considered entertainment at all and should not be restricted to the same level as "top 10 funny cat" videos.

This is why the extension is built in a way that encourages viewer to watch more complete and long videos, as well as finishing each video instead of being addicted to short dopamine hits.

### Features
1. Blocks youtube page after daily limit is reached
2. A popup menu that lets you set the daily limit and a button to reset the counter for today
3. Number of watched videos will be cleared everyday
4. Watching a video more than once will not count towards the quota
